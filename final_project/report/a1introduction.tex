Most complicated electronics like computers and smartphones make use of direct current (DC) for their power as the voltage and current are both constant. This means that the components do not have to deal with the stresses and instability associated with an alternating current (AC) power source. AC power sources do not have a voltage which is constant in time; rather it varies periodically between a maximum positive voltage and minimum negative voltage, passing through zero volts along the way. This introduces some difficulties into the circuit theory, when compared with DC. The best way to deal with the mathematics of AC circuits is to use complex numbers. The magnitude of the complex numbers is then taken to find the actual values like resistance and capacitance.

This report aims to outline the design and implementation of a program written in C++ to calculate the impedence of AC circuits consisting of ideal resistors, capacitors and inductors in any combination in series or parallel.

\section*{AC circuit theory}
  Ohm's law for AC circuits is
  \begin{equation}\label{eqn:1}
    E=\frac{I}{Z},
