% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  A program is presented for the manipulation and storage of alternating current circuits. Series and parallel circuits can be constructed using an arbitrary number of resistors, capacitors, inductors or other circuits composed of the listed components. Impedences of all components in the circuit as well as the total impedence of the circuit are calculated and circuits diagrams can be printed. The program allows the user to save the current project to a file and load old projects from a file. The program is designed to fully comply with the current \CC{} standard and to make use of advanced features of object oriented programming included in \CC11.
